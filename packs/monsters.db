I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deitie’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or prosthelytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deitie’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp; Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.&nbsp; Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

46.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Blink Dogs are a notable curiosity amongst the common canine species.&nbsp; On the outside, the hound appears to be quite similar to many a hunting mutt: a tannish, yellow complexion of the fur, average in size (standing anywhere from two and a half to three feet in height) and no markings or traits rendering it particularly unique.&nbsp; However, the secret of this dog lies within.&nbsp; The Blink Dog possesses an uncanny ability to “blink” or teleport at will from location to location in a flash.&nbsp; In a similar vein to the spells utilized by mages to transport themselves across distances in a flash, the Blink Dog tears through the fabric of our reality, vanishes instantaneously and appears up to forty feet away from its original location.&nbsp; The Blink Dog is unable to carry living things along with it, however any equipment or objects the hound currently holds will be transported.&nbsp; Blink Dogs have an above average intelligence in comparison to other canines and are able to speak their own language, called “Blink Dog”, to others of their kind.&nbsp; What these discussions entail is a mystery, though it is speculated that often the packs of dogs will discuss their intense hatred for other ethereal quadrupeds as they are known to attack the beasts on sight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;
